bucket sort:
nums = [7,10,10,2,6,3,6,7,7,2,2,2]
d={7:3,2:4,6:2,3:1}
t=[(7,3),(2,4),(6,2),(3,1),(4,3),(8,2]

by using bucket sort we will place that number at the frequency position,
take the lists inside lists by max frequency + 1

b = [ [], [3], [6,8], [7,4], [2] ]
       0   1     2       3    4

now result is

res=[the value in list]*frequency 
(extent the list)
